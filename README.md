# Mark-Sheet-app
A simple basic app in C++which stores your name, roll number and marks and furthermore lets you add, view, delete and update entries.

Just downlaod the Mark Sheet.exe file if you want to use the app, otherwise if you want to look at the source code it's available in the repository as main.cpp

If you just wish to see wether the code works or not, open the output word file and look at the outputs. I've included every possible output that I could think of.
